cross-stitch
===

---

A collection of information to make it easier to find tools/resources to cross-stitch and showcase my own work.

For information contact me at: `enckse[at]gmail.com` or visit me [here](https://voidedtech.com)


The following galleries are intended to provide:

- Examples of using the above tools
- Finished patterns using the produced patterns
- Patterns (or source) to stitch the items yourself!

The patterns should be seen more as a guide (especially around color) as you may want to adjust or find alternative canvas (cloth) colors and/or like certain styling more (or less).
