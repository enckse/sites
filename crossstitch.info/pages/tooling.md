- [kxstitch](https://www.kde.org/applications/graphics/kxstitch/) for designing patterns from images/scratch
- [pyxstitch](https://cgit.voidedtech.com/pyxstitch) to convert source code to patterns

As a software engineer I am utilizing some of my knowledge to build tools (e.g. pyxstitch) but, of note, cross-stitch patterns are a prime candidate for [reverse engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering). If you find a completed pattern/image (and the size is reasonable) you can create a pattern if it is not available for purchase, download, etc.
